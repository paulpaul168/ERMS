## Overview

Welcome to ERMS (Emergency Responder Messaging System) - the ultimate solution for enhancing communication within Red Cross teams operating in loud and noisy environments. ERMS is a cutting-edge app designed for Wear OS smartwatches, enabling team members to send critical messages through quick taps on their wrists. With ERMS, Red Cross responders can stay connected, informed, and coordinated even in the most challenging situations.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Communication**: ERMS facilitates swift and efficient communication among team members with tap-based actions.

- **Noise-Proof Messaging**: In loud and chaotic environments, ERMS ensures that important messages are transmitted without getting lost.

- **Emergency Alerts**: Initiate emergency alerts instantly to notify the control center about urgent situations.

- **GPS Integration**: Share real-time location by using Bluetooth beacons. This dramatically improves the coordination process.

## Installation

At this stage, ERMS is still under heavy development but in the future, you will just be able to use the Google Play Store to install the app. Simply search for it and hit the install button.

## Usage

Using ERMS is intuitive and straightforward:

1. **Launch ERMS**: Open the ERMS app on your smartwatch.
2. **Passive Mode**: In passive mode the app shows a nice watch face and waits for actions.
3. **Choose Action**: If an emergency responder needs to contact the control center they just have to swipe up repeatedly until the desired message comes up. 
4. **Send the Message**: Once the desired action has been selected, it can be confirmed via a double tap. This will transfer the message to the control center and let them know what is happening.
